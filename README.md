# ChatApplication
Client/server chat application. Based on QT6
To test the operation, you can run .exe file from <Client part> and <Server part>. Project files are also attached. In general, this work was done more to familiarize with the capabilities of the Qt library and the client/server architecture.

# Need to start the server

# Launch the client and click <connect to server>

If there are errors in the connection: 
1) from the client side - it will close 
2) from the server side an error about a possible error will come out

# If started correctly, you can start a chat with all connected clients

# During the chat from the client side, the server will display information about the process of sending messages.
